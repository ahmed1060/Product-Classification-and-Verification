# Product-Classification-and-Verification
Computer Vision Project to automate tasks such as inventory management, pricing. For example, a retailer could use this technology to automatically identify and classify products in a store, and then use this information to update inventory levels, calculate products prices, and provide with information about the products.
Project Objectives:
1. Apply Image preprocessing or Feature Extraction techniques 
where needed.
2. Train at least one classification model to determine the product 
category. You can use Classical computer vision or deep learning. 
3. Train a one/few shot learning model (e.g., Siamese) to verify if a 
product exists and recognize its type.
